# AboutðŸ†” 

I am Natalie Perret, a Software Developer, currently based in Paris and working @ [Veepee](https://www.veepee.com). 

I like to talk and write about mental health, work, and software development.

## Some bits about myself

- I am working with F#, C# (marginally), TypeScript and Rust (with parsimony) stuff at work.
- I am currently learning Rust (cause I am clearly not an expert), Go (re-learning it cause I wanna help with it at work), TypeScript (not doing great) and Zig (my own quirks).
- You can probably ask my help about .NET, C# or F#.
- You can reach out to me on:

  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-perret)
- Pronouns: she/her/hers.
